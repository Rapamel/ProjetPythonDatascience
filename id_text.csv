Ill 1 BILL MINES.!
I
A News Man Spends a Few Hours
Sight Seeing. Going Down
the Shaft. The Tunnel.
????
FOREMAN HUNTER AS GUIDE.
Who lias not hoard of the wonderful;
Trcadwell mines? The greatest, mine?
the largest stamp mill in the world.
Ono pf the first things the News man j
thought of after locating at Douglas j
City was a trip to Treadwell, not to go
and look at the buildings and see the !
stamps pound the ore so fine that it j
looks like buckwheat flour, but to go
down into the bowols of old mother j
earth and follow the ore until it passes
through the various stages and becomes;
a thing of real value.
Our wishes were made known to
Foreman Hunter and in part our desire
was realized 011 last Saturduy; leaving ;
a portion of our sight seeing for some
future time. Wo met Mr. Qonter at.
the shaft about ten oclock in the fore- |
. ii 1 _r ii.? 1
i noon ana me engineer ui rue uui?ui
j engines stopped one of the skips and
: wo climbed on. We stood on the edge
! of the box and were let down so easily
I
! and gently that it remiudcd us of a I
; beautiful dream. Wo made our land
! ing on the first level, which is down
i 110 feet below the surface. We were j
; each provided with a candle, for the'
electric light is not in all parts of the
j many tunnels through which we |
passed.
At tho place where we landed are tiu- j
1 merous iron tracks on which the ore is
conveyed on cars to a bin some fifty j
feet in depth and. which holds 200 tons !
of ore. We started out toward tho l
end of the tunnel, which has a high!
ceiling and is wide enough for a team
and wagon to travel on. Along either 1
j side are numerous chutes that are!
; filled with ore, and Manager Hunter,
iuformed us that if tho blasting were J
| stopped, the ore constantly on hand j
would be sufficient to run the mill for
at least three months. Wo soon reach
ed two men who were running a drill
with compressed air. They had a wall
| pretty well peforated. but were still j
i drilling in more holes. Two feet was j
the depth of the holes they made.
.. J
""How much ore will you blow our of i
that place?"" asked the scribe,
j ""About thirty tons,"" was the reply, j
""And how far do you go away when ;
the discharge takes place?"" asked the j
News man.
""Oh, around the corner a little ways,""
was the reply.
Our judgment was that we would
j prefer to be away a half a mile and we
haven't changed our mind yet on the
| subject.
We followed that tunnel some four i
hundred feet until wo came to a hole
j that Manager Hunter told us was 100
I feet deep. It extended clear across the
tunnel and we had no desire to go any
; further, and Mr. Hunter no doubt
; viewed the situation in the same light:
1 we did, for we turned and cut across \
into another tunnel that is still longer
and where the cross sections are as nu- i
merous. We traveled over 1100 feet j
through the tunnel, and think of it,
from the surface down hundreds ot
feet through solid ore. This vein is
more than 400 feet wide, but just how
far it extends in downward course, no |
one knows, bnt for more than 500 feet:
is known to a certainty.
Six or seven little cars are constantly I
running from the chutes down to where
the ore is hauled up to the crusher,
which we will see later on. The load- j
ing of these cars is done by a man who
raises tho trap door to the mouth of I
tho chute. The cars are at present run
by hand to the place where the ore is ;
dumped into the big bin before men-;
tioned, but the company is arranging
to run these cars by electricity. Here :
the man oowor stops short. From
; there the ore is all handled by ma- i
chinery, and how much do you think
| the stamps will use in a day? 250 tons, i
i Just think of it, 250 tons of ore is;
I 1
J mined, crushed and ground as fine as
: Hour every twenty-four hours.
i We wandered around the caverns for j
some time and returned to the shaft: i
I :
and soon we were up in the hoisting;
engine rooms and from there we climbed >
up flights of stairs until we reached j
the room in which two crushers get in
their awful work. We expected to find
a mill, a great big strong iron mill!
built on the same principle of those
, i i
little domestic machines we grind,
or used to grind coffee in, and we
thought the teeth would be even larg
er than a Tacoma girl's foot, but the
crusher is a most harmless looking ma
chine, and just the opposite of what
we expected to see. In the center of
the room are two concave disks or
hoppers we should probably cell them.
The ore comos down an incline chute
from the hoisting boxes where thoy are
automatically emptied. In the center
of the disk is a round opening some
three feet wide, and in the center of
this opening, a little lower down is a
round cylinder two or three feet long
that revolves and moves laterally at
the same time. The ore falls between
this disk and the basin iu which it is
set and tho disk just crushes it into
small pieces, and when broken to a cer
tain size it drops down into a bin below.
Two men are in tho crusher room to
keep tho large pieces of ore from clog
ging the hopper. The ore as it comes
down the chute is sometimes in large
pieces and those employed at the
crusher are constantly on the watch to
keep out of the course of the heavy
We next go down several flights of
6tairs into the room whero the stamps
are running. Have you ever been in a
stamp mill ? If you haven't, you never
beard any noise. You may think you
havo but my friend you are mistaken.
This mill has 240 stamps, all going at
the same time. Talking in there is
never thought of. Stampmill language
is by means of signs.
We were only too glad when Fore
man Hunter conducted us into a side
room, whero we could think and talk.
It proved to be the office of Mr. Win.
M.Hale, foreman of the stamp mill, who
is a genial, pleasant geutloman. Wo
were also pleased to moet Mr. Nick
King who is employed in the amalga
mating department. Here wo bade
Foreman Hunter goodbye for the duy.
There is much to be seen and a great
deal to be said as we follow the course
of the precious metal at the Tread well
and a future issue will contain more
upon this subject.
Saturday was a cold dreary day and
our stay at the mines was limited.
The new stamp mill which is neariug
completion is larger than the one we
visited and will contain 300stamps, but
we did not go into the building. We
also made no mention of the tunnels
one hundred feet below the one we wore
in, the ""glory hole"" and the many other
places of interest.
When ono considers the magnitude of
the Treadwell mines, ono naturally
wonders what master mind is superin
tendent of this groat plant and others,
as well as the writer, will be surprised
to know that a young man, less than
forty years of age, has charge of these
works and successfully conducts them
?an enterprise that employs some 700
men?included in which is also ono of
the greatest general stores in Alaska,
and equal to those on the Pacific coast.
The name of this man is J. P. Corbus.
piCWUO UL U1U.
From the crusher room we go just
below, where we see a train of small
cars backing up under the chute that
holds the crushed ore. Thore are five
or six of the cars to which is attached
the cutest little engine you ever saw.
It is a little bit of a thing, not over
three or four feet high, and is minus a
cab and tender. One man runs this
little locomotive. The diminutive size
of the machine makes the man that
runs it look several sizes larger than
the ordinary man, in fact we thought
he must bo betwoon sevou and ten feot
tall. We didn't get the best kind of a
look at him, but we thought he rode
the engine liko the girls did the old
gray mare, when the writer was a boy,
?a-straddlo, but we might have been
mistaken.
When the cars are loaded the litilo
engine pulls them into the mill where
they empty into bins far above the
stamps,into which it is fed automati
cally.
A Good Chicken Story.
A story is going the rounds of the
papers about a man who tried the ex
periment of mixing sawdust with his
chicken feed. The results were so sat
isfactory that he discontinued the uso
of meal altogether and fed his chickens
entirely on sawdust. Soon after adopt
ing the scheme he set a hen with fif
teen eggs. She brought off thirteen
chicks. Twelve of them had wooden
legs and the thirteenth was e wood
pecker.

11 NEI GOLD FIELDS.
? ? ?
A Trip into the Atlin and Pine
Creek Country, by a Douglas
City Man
? f
MR. P. H. McGUIRE TALKS,
Mr. P. H. McGuire, of Douglas City,
accompanied by a man named G. W.
Mathews, left this city sometimo du
ring the latter part of last February
on a prospecting tour, into the Lake
Teslin country. Before returning, the
party went down the lakes and wore
within thirty miles of Pino Creek
which has since that time become fa
mous as a new mining region. A trail
into these new gold fields has been
I found and improved, by way of Doug
las City and Juneau, and from the fact
that the McGuire party passed over a
greater portion of this new inlet, the
i News man concluded that a few items
1 of interest concerning the trail nnd
country could be gained for our read
| ers by looking up the prospector and
. interviewing him.
""I understand you have once been,
very near the Pine Creek placer miues,""
! said the News mau, ""and we would bo
j 1
pleased to have you give the readers of
the News some information concerning
it.""
""Yes, Mr. G. W. Mathews and myself
| left this place the latter part of Fobru
, ary of this year. Of course we knew
; nothing concerning the strike at Pine
: Creek and wore simply out prospecting.
We first headed for Lake Teslin, and
the first forty miles is made in a boat,
going down the Gastrinoaux channel
to Bishop's point, thence up the Taku
inlet 28 miles, which lauds us at the
mouth of the Tuku rivor on the ice.
The mouth of this river is about three
| miles wide. We wont up the river to
; tho head waters of the Taku. a distance
of about fifty miles, to the confluence
; of the Inkliu and Knacunaw rivers
: where the Tuku river boffins. We then
; followed up the Knacunaw to the Sil
! ver Salmon which was about twenty-six
1 miles. From the Silver Salmon to
Lake Tesliu is a distance of about 8ix
ty miles and is a low and practically
level country. We each had a four
I dog team and carried in all twenty
eight hundred pounds to tho lake. Tho
i most difficult part of the trail we en
countered thus far was in going around
the Sinwauklin mountains, which took
| two or three days of our time. From
Lake Teslin we returned to the Silver
, Salmon over the samo route wo had
previously traveled. Wo went up tho
Silver Salmon river into the Atliu lake
j country where we were within about
' thirty miles of Pino Creek.""
""What can you say as to tho practi
? cability of this routo you traveled over
as a summer routo to Pino Creek ?""
was asked.
""Well, 1 think the route to be practi
cable. The packing part of the routo
? in the summer would bo about fifty
miles. There is plenty of good feed
along tho way and horses aud cattle
could 1x3 used. Tho soil is principally
I of a gravelly nature and very firm. A
survey has recently been made which
j confirms my judgment. For winter
travel it is good, all one could reason
ably ask for.""
""How did your prospocting tour pau
out?""
j ""Wo found colors on three of the riv
era wo were on and also aovoral crooks,
but did not go to bed rock. I shall re
i turn, however, after tho holidays and
more thoroughly prospect tho stream*,
i I Know the gold is there and expect to
find it. Wo were probably the first per
sons who over prospected on the rivers
I have mentioned.""
Mr. McGuire further said that he
thought small river steamers could go
up the Taku river as far as the Inklin
, during tho high water season, and pack
ing can be easily done from there into
the Atlin lake country.
Mr. McGuire has been in Alaska for
tho last two years and at presont is em
ployed at tho Troadwell mines, lie u
a man of intelligence and education,
j a close obsorver and posessed of a good
memory, a good talker and wo boliovo
his description of the route over which
I he traveled is truthful. His appear -
j ance denotes a man of abundance of
| nerve and wo sincerely trust that hie
| second trip up the Taku may prove
' more than successful, yes that he will
Hud more gold t han he and his four
dog team may be able to pull out into
civilization. * \ ?' -"

Where Is It?
Douglas City is located on Douglas j
island and joins the town of Treadwell, 1
where the greatest stamp mill in the j
world is operated. The towns of Doug- i
las City and Treadwell have all thej
branches of trade represented within '
their limits aud every dealer is doing a
prosperous business. The population j
is between 2500 and .'1000 people, and the
pay roll at the mines reaches close to
800 men, whiih, however will be in- j
creased to 1500 or 2000 within the next j
six months. There is one wharf at;
Douglas City and one at Treadwell.
These towns are two and one half i
miles from Juneau and a ferry boat
plies between the towns making five
trips a day, but which will soou be in-J
creased. New buildings are going up 1
in every direction and there is not an
empty store room or dwelling in town.
Rents are reasonable. The supply of
carpenters seems to be inadequate to !
the demand. The business men are all'
live, prosperous men and here to stay.
Money for any public enterprise is lib
erally supplied. A new 6J500 church;
is now in course of construction. If
you want to come to Alaska, come to
the future great town of the district,
Douglas City and Treadwell.
Always Solemn.
?very race of beings has its peeul- j
iarities and the most striking of the
Alaska Indian, is solemnity. Wher-1
ever you find the Indian you will ob- j
serve that same grave expression on his i
countenance. We have seen him at the ;
dance where ""joy was uncontined,"" j
with the feathers flying in every direc
tion and the dancers jumping, kicking
and puffing in such a manner as to sat
isfy the desire of the most enthusiastic
and ardent spectator, but not a smile
was visible. We have seen him by the
side of a coffin that held that which is
supposed to be ueareet and dearest to '
humanity, civilized or uncivilized, and
yet the same pensive look was upon his
face that we observed at the dance. We
have seen him at the grave, and as the !
dull, heavy thud of the clods of earth
covered the remains of a wife or child,
his solemnity seemed no more appar- (
ent than when he was roaming through
the forest in search of game.
We saw a young Indian and his wife ,
coming towards us on the sidwealk the :
other day. Just ahead of them was
their little two and a half year old babe <
which was slowly toddling along. They | ]
were both intently watching the child. 11
It was their first-born.' They were well 1
dressed and among the brightest of <
! /
their race. Did they smile as they
looked at the little tot as it wabbled
along 011 the sidewalk? No, indeed,
their faces were as expressionless as j
the outside of an imported Swiss
cheese. Love the little thing? Why
yes, as much as any mother and father
love their olfspring.
They are a sorrowful appearing race
and if you ever obsorve an expression
of mirthfuluess on their countenances
it is the exception and not the rule.
McGINTY IN SIGHT.
Narrow Escape of the Utopia on Her last Up
Trip. Tied Up at the Wharf. Did She
Violate the Law.
_
The little Sound steamer Utopia
came near, awful near, going to see Mc- '
Ginty at the bottom of the sea ou her !
last trip up and that she escaped the '
misfortune, borders closely on the mi-1
raculous. She made the trip up with- i
out mishap until she reached a place !
about twelve miles this side of Capo
Faushaw, at which place, where the'
channel is very wide, a lamp upsot in ;
the captain's cabin, which set the bed!
clothes on fira, which spread very rap-;
idly and soon burned the ropes of the j
steering gear. There being no other'
provision on the boat for steering, sho
rolled helplessly in the sea.
The confusion was intense among the ;
passengers, but the officers finally
launched the life raft which was at j
once pounded to pieces by the waves.;
A boat was next lowered aud a passen- 1
ger jumped into it, but the waves dash-1
ed it to pieces and there was one less !
of the passengers. By this time the |
crew got the hose coupled on aud tho j
pumps into action aud the tire was j
speedily extinguished aud order was
restored. Tho steering ropes were re-1
paired and tho plucky little boat made j
another start for this place, but luck
was still against her, and when she j
reached Taku inlet, alxnit fiftoeu miles
from this city and while in a place of
shelter, her wheel struck something and
off went two of her propeller blades, J
and within a few minutes off went the
third blade and then she was in a fix;!
she commenced drifting towards the
rocky beach, but as good fortune would !
have it, the Farallon happened to- lie
coming along aud she took the disa-J
bled boat in tow and safely brought
her to Juueau, where she now lies help-;
less aud forlorn.
If our understanding of the United
States laws is correct, every boat, and
especially that class which carry pas- j
sengers, is required to be provided
with relieving tackle, that is tackle !
which can be attached to the rudder,
lever so that in case the ropes are part
ed or destroyed, tho boat may still be
steered by this extra gear. Wo under-1
stand the Utopia is running without!
this relieving tackle and if so, why?
Perhaps the Seattle inspectors, who
frequently do some very careless work,
can explain the matter. If, as we are
informed, the Utopia has been violat- j
ing the law, in the manner indicated,
the cause for being allowed to do so
should be made known.
Steward Sanders,
While at Juneau laat Monday evening
the News man boarded the Topeka to
take a look at the ""wild Irishman"" who
has held the position of steward on
that boat since tho year 1.
""If you don't quit calling me an Irish
man we will have trouble,"" said Stew- '
ard Sanders to tho scribe, the moment j
he caught sight of the writer.
"" And if you don't quit lying about
your nationality tho office paralyzer
will be turned loose on you,"" was the
reply.
Sanders is a pretty good fellow, but
he will insist on calling himself a
Johnny Bull.
It Blew.
A severe wind storm has prevailed in ;
these parts for the past week, and it
made things hcwl. The News office
opened for business in a new building
with an uncompleted chimney, and for
two days and a half we were smoked 1
out of house and home. A galvanized |
extension was put up by contractor ;
Boyce last Sunday afternoon but at
about 11 o'clock that night it blew
down and scared three hours of sleep
and seven brilliant ideas out of the
senior editor. A coal famine has also
I
prevailed in the city and the wood we ;
were able to get was too wet to burn. J
But this did not end our trouble: our
I
foreman spent an hour trying to find j
a clean spot on our office towel and !
we lost that time also. Considering
the difficulties encountered, we feel
'
thankful that we have been able to is
sue this number before the holidays.
The Al-Ki was in port last week and
brought up a full cargo of freight. She
lid not go any further north than this :
place. She had her whistle with her
and bellowed and bawled around the
four wharves nearby for three or four
lays and then slid out for Seattle.
FROM UP THE COAST.
Deputy Collector Thomas Back. HIb Talk with
the News Man.
Mr. W. G. Thomas, a resident of
Alaska for the past twenty years, and
his most estimable wife, returned to
this part of Alaska recently. Mrs.
Thomas had pone from Fort VVrangel
to Juneau to meet her husband. Mr.
Thomas is direct from Kodiak where
he was deputy collector, having also
served in the same capacity in other |
portions of Alaska. Mr. Thomas was j
seon at his residence at VVrangel by a
News man, and when asked concerning
some of his Alaska experiences said: j
""I went to the Sand Point custom j
house 011 Popofi' island, in May, 1804,1
and remained there until May, 1800, at j
which time the custom house wns j
changed to Unga, on Unga island. In j
** io/u> r ? 1 4.? I
lUUy, louu, l was nuuoionuu i.u ivuuiuk
island, the distance between the two
being about 3(X) miles.""
""That must be a great country up
there,"" suggested the writer.
""Yes, Unga and Popoff islands are
treeless. The country is low and there
are no impediments to chock the wind.
Codfish are in abundance and two cur
ing stutions have boon there for years.
The Appollo mine is located about
four miles from Unga with forty
stamps aud a good output.""
""That must be a great place for
thought and reflection. Iiow terribly
lonesome you must have been up
there,"" said the News man.
""No, not near so much as one would
imagiuo. One becomes accustomed to
it and the time flies as rapidly as any
where. Wo had quite a little town at
Kodiak and, strange to say, there never
has been a saloon there. The people
supported mo in keeping the liquor
business out of tlie town. At Kodiak,
the climate is about the same as it is J
in Fort Wrangel. I wish to toll you I
also about some tree culture up in Un- j
alaska. Twenty years ago some one |
planted three treos at that place and !
they are all alive, but have not grown a '
particle. The place where the trees!
are planted is called The grove.' ""
Mr. and Mrs. Thomas showed the i
writer a beautiful collection of photo
graphic views taken in that part of
Alaska. Mr Thomas has kindly con- i
sented to give the News another inter- J
view concerning that country which wo !
know will interest our readers.
Her Troubles Ended.
Somo months ugo the little steamer !
Diana was libeled at Fort Wrangel at J
the instauco of a party named Barclay. |
Artwick Dahl is master of the vessel!
and he contested the action for all he I
is worth. The facts of the case were that
the boat was chartered for prospecting
purposes and in this enterprise Bar- j
clay the plaintiff was interested as a j
partner. Judge Suudtnaeher, of Fort
Wrangel, was appoiuted by Judge!
Johuson to take the evidence and sub-1
mit findings, which was done, resulting j
in a recommendation that the action j
be dismissed, which was confirmed by j
Judge Johnson, last Monday.
Capt. Dahl, when seen by a News1
man was very jubilant over the result j
of the action, and is especially pleased
with the work in getting this ground- j
less, though vexatious suit, dismissed.

Skaguay's Fire. h
On the evening of the 19th inst., a !
most disastrous fire occurred at Skag '

some vehicles was also consumed in
the flames, besides one dwelling house.
The loss is estimated at $2b0,000.
Some of the railroad employees were j,
sleoping in tho office and they wore so !
badly burned that they are not expect- j

English Boats, Keep Off.
The Queen City, a small ateai ?r that
hails from Vancouver, and is on led by
an English company and marine by a
Canadian or English crew, mat her
initial trip to this country last week.
She had a small passenger list, a d, we
understand, can only accommoate a
few. Whether the passengers wre fed
on rotten tisli and second class Igrub,
which is the usual fare </n Hglish
boats, we don't know, but we will mger
a good hat that Americans will fa 3 ten
times as well on a straight Amrican
ship. A few months ago, an Eiflish
vessel landed at Fort Wraugel o her
way down and the passengers won to
the town restaurants and paid : >r a
square meal. We forget the nam of
the boat. She was a lino looking ves
sel and that is what fools so many peo
ple. If you are going to the Sound ake
a Pacific Coast Steamship Co. steaner,
or that of some other American Ine,
and you will get good quarters knd
first class meals.
It should not be forgotten that at
McKay's butcher shop, you can get
either a fine Turkey, Goose, Chicken or
Duck for your Thanksgiving diuter.
Prices reasonable.

We were pleased to meet Deputy
Marshal Grant, of Fort Wrangel, who
is attending court at Juneau. He is
one of the best and cleanest officers in
Alaska. Marshal Shoup got the right
man when he sent Grant to that city.
Don't complain of dyspepsia or a bad
stomach if you are out of whack, for in
nine times out of ten the trouble is that
your teeth need attention. Go to Dr.
Harrison, in the new Hunter building,
Douglas City, and get first-class work
at reasonable prices. .
Dr. Harrison moved into his new
dental parlors, between Front and Sec
ond streets, last Monday. Unquestion
ably they are the finest and most com
plete and convenient dental rooms in
Alaska, and we are pleased to know
that the Doctor has the business to
maintain such elegant quarters.
Mr. Fox seemingly enjoys a joke as
much as any one, and his latest is well
worth repeating. The Juneau Record i
reached his store last Saturday and ?
Mr. ""SVeesner was sitting by the stove;
^ . enjoying a good Are when Mr. Fox J
asked his caller if he had seen the new
' Douglas City paper. Mr. Weesner said
% he had not and Mr. Fox handed him a
^3?lopy of the Record, and he read nearly
all of it before he discovered the joke.
Mr. P. H. Fox, the merchant, is agent
for fhe Royal Tailors of Chicago. He t
has just received 1000 samples of jcloth
and will take measures for men's
clothing which will be delivered to you
in this city, tailor made, at from $10.00
to $40.00. The book in which the sam-;
pies are kept, is a work of art; it is ;
about two feet square and five inches
thick; and opposite each page of sam- j
pies is a page of pictures of interest. |
Go and see it and get prices.
The Topeka, Thompson captain j
reached this place Monday morning,
but owing to the rough sea, did not try
to land until late in the evening which
was effected at the wharf at Juneau. A
News man met the captain, who was in
the best of humor. He has entirely
recovered from the shock that was pro
""*? duced by the rickety old wharf at Kil
lisnoo running against his boat. The
The vessel sustained no injury, but
they have built a new wharf since the
collision.

The Miller Cornet Band of this city
will give a grand ball to-morrow night,1
at Oilman's hall. The music will bo
first class and a general good time is j
expected. A complimentary ticket was ^
received at this office and the editor is ;
having his shoe heels securely fastened
to-day for the occasion.
Our old friend Louis L. Blunienthal'
has an advertisement on the local page I
under the heading of the Brownville I
Woolen Mills. It. is one of the neatest, j
cleanest and best stores in Alaska, and i
buying there simply means that you are
buying of the manufacturer. His line
of gent's furnishing goods is the finest
in Alaska. One branch of his store is
a blessing, yes a real blessing, to Alas
kans. You can go there and have your ;
measure taken, select your goods from
1300 samples and get a suit of clothes
made to order that will cost you only
815, and he don't ask any deposit either.
Go and see the store and get acquaint
ed with Mr. Blumenthal, ask him to see
his samples and you will go back again
sure.
Mr. Keetcn, chief clerk at McKay's,
his wife and boy, will leave for Seattle
on the Cottage City, where they will
spend the holidays. The News wishes
them a most pleasant visit and a safe
and speedy return. But what will Mc
Kay do without him ?
Fefl 1500 Feet.
Robert Davis, a Welchman, about
' twenty seven years of ago, who was em
i ployed at Sheop Creek, met with an ac
cident last Saturday that cost him his
! life. He was up at the (ilacier mines
j and while returning to the mill, he lost
1 the trail, which at best is a dangerous
one, and while crossing a canyon he
; slipped and fell down the mountain a
distance of 1500 feet. His ribs, arms
and legs were broken and his head was
1 crushed. An employe at the mines saw
| him fall and he was speedily rescued, j
: A physician was called but 110 human
j power could save him with the injuries
: he sustained, and yet it was two hours
I after the accident before life was ex
j tinct. Mr. Davis had many friends at
j the mines and all who knew him spoke
I of his many virtues in tho highest
j praise.

The nearer we get to locking up the I
forms of this issue, the more we be
come convinced that the lirst number,
of the News will not be entirely satis-1
factory in make-up and appearance.!
We were smoked out of our office for :
several days this week, which threw us
behind with our work.
When you go to Juneau to do your;
trading, always go to the Kohler-James
store. There are many reasons why
you should do this. In tho first place
you will save money, for you can get
tho same goods cheaper thpre than any
place in town. Then the manager and
his clerks are so pleasant and accomo
dating. You can't find a ""Smart Alex""
among them. Another reason is you
can get just what you want, for they
run the largest stock in Alaska. By
all means go to the store anyhow, even
if you don't trade there that trip; no
tice how nice and pleasant customers
are waited on, and if you give them a
trial you will do your trading there.
We were so fortunate as to secure
the services of Mr. W. O. Graham to as
sist us in the News office. All around
newspaper men are hard to find in
Alaska, but luck favored us with assis
tance that is so satisfactoay that we
would ask for no better. Mr. Graham
formerly run a big job office in Kansas
City, but his thirst for goici orougnt
him here. He intends to go to Atlin
in the spring at which time the office
will put on a dress of deep mourning.
We regret that we could not attend
the mask ball recently held in this city.
It was a swell affair. The costumes
were elegant, unique and comical, as
the wearer preferred. One gentleman
wore a pair of trousers with holes in
the seat. His underwear was whole,
however. The music was good and the
dancers all reported a pleasant time.
J. G. Quinn, of the Juneau Electric
Construction Co., was in the city yes
terday. He has lots of friends in this
city and is deserving of them.
ALASKA CLIMATE.
I
Erroneous Impressions Concerning nn Alaska
Winter. Not Near So Cold as the Western
States. Ex-Chief Jack .McDonald on
Wind.
Alaska weather is peculiar. It is a
climate of spells and moods. There is
j only orio thing connected with it that
is a real sure, dead certainty?it is cer
tain to rain. Sometimes it rains hard
i and sometimes it is so gentle and soft
you scarce can hear, but rain it will.
I Douglas Island climate is new to us,
but we are seeking for knowledge con
I cerning it and in our search for infor
mation we dropped onto the fact that
1 once in a while the air gets itself into
a motion that is liable to surprise a
new-comer. Old settlers call it a Ta
' ku wind, but, from what we can learn,
the name is too mild to correctly de
j scribe it.
i ""Go and sec Jack McDonald ir you
! want to know .anything about wind,""
said a Douglas City man to the ""wind""
! reporter of the News, ""he can tell you
I all about it, but dont try to find him
! until in the afternoon, for he sleeps
until noon.""
The News man found Jack, the same
irrepressible Jack, who is ex-chief of
the Seattle flro department and was
deputy sheriff for more than four years
in the Queen City. His power of speech,
good humor, and good looks has not
yet deserted him?no, he is the same
Jack McDonald and always will bo un
til the pearly gates swing open for him.
After the usual afternoon salutations
the News man addressed the ex-chief
as follows^
""Mr. McDonald, it nas come to tne
knowledge of the News office that you
are the beet posted man on wind there
is on Douglas island, and our readers
abroad, if not at this place, will be
pleased to gain some knowledge upon
the peculiar ""symptoms"" of this coun
try in that line. Can you impart some
of your most valuable information for
the benefit of the readers of the News.
Mr. McDonald drew a long sigh and
said: ""I can tell you a few things on
the subject of wind and especially the j
peculiar species that prevails at this j
season of the year on Douglas Island j
nnd the surrounding country. In the !
first place, to correctly understand
what I may say on this subject it must
be understood that the word Taku,
which gives its name to the 'high flyer'
of this country, is of Indian origin, and
means hell, the place spoken of in the
Bible and so much dreaded by saint
and sinner, so that when you hear a
man say that a Taku wind is coming, he
means it will be a h?lof a wind, or, in
other words, a wind that is nearly h?1.
""Yes, we have some wind up this way,
you bet! I have known of winds in |
Seattle that blew cars off the railroad
track into the bay, have seen trees go
down by the hundreds, known of winds
that blew all the water out of a 28 foot
well, why sir, I have attended a Pop
convention when Bob Bridges had the
"" r ^ 4- ?MmufAfl Kn f oil
11001* inr imrby-tJIgilU uiuim<cn, uuu an
these winds are nothing as compared
to a certain class of very rare winds
that swoop down on us once in a gr^at
while from the direction of Juneau and
engage in sundry and divers flirtations
with the stockings of the dusky beau
ties, who mako their homes on the
beach of Douglas Island.
""You have heard of Hank Osborn's ,
dog, haven't you?"" Jack asked the
News man. >
We explained how recently we had
come to town and our inability to hear
of Douglas City's famous dogs.
"" Well anyhow, Hank has a dog, a j
! boar dog, and ho got him to hunt bear
| with oil Admiralty island. That dog
is, and always was, so thin he scarcely
made a shadow. Well, last fall Hank
' and that thin dog started out on the
Douglas City dock while one of those
winds was blowing and it blew that
dog from one side of the approach to
the other and into tho bay.
""You would hardly believe itT but
about the same time, the same day I
think, Asbury Johnson started out to
the wharf with a pack of blankets on
his back, and one of these winds we
call a 'woolly' struck him. Asbury
wound his legs around one of the posts,
and his arms around the railing and in
that way saved himself, but the blan
kets were blown off of his back into
the bay, breaking two pood inch straps
beforojthey ""flew."" Wind! Why, I
should say .we do have some winds.
Well the blankets floated ashore and
he borrowed a sled, strappedtb? blank
ets onto it and pulled the outfit onto
the dock, where he dumped them off
I to let some of the water run out of
I them. He took the sled back to its.
owner and returned to the wharf, for
he was going to Dyea. liy this time
j the steamer arrived and when he went
i to load his bundle of wet blanket*
j they were frozen solidly to the wharf
: floor. Tho steamer waited until he
J could get an ax and chop them loose.
Why man, you talk about wind, wait
until a'woolly' strikes you. You will
j never be 'in it' until then. Why I
could fill your paper with anecdotes
j about our wind, but I will give you
| just one more.
I ""One of the 'seven virgins' who lives
i down on the water front went into
| Bach's store one morning and bought a
i pair of rubbers, that high kind called
i storm rubbers. She put them on and
i started for the wharf, to go to Juneau.
Before she got to the dock the wind
blew both of her rubbers off into the
bay.
""You may know how to try a luw
suit or run a newspaper, but my friend
you don't know anything about wind,""
and unless Jack is the biggest liar that
ever lived, we are free to confess that
we can yet gain much information con
cerning Taku and Woolly winds.
Thank.* Awfully.
The baud boys desire to return their
most sincere thanks to Mr. J. P. Smith
for the liberal donation that he made
to them a short time ago. Mr. Smith
is one of the wide-awake business men
of the city and can always be depend
ed on when liberality and enterprise
are at stake. \
Eat, Drink, and Bo Merry.
Go to Dan McKay's butcher shop
and get a nice turkey for your Thanks
giving dinner. They are as choice as
can bo found in the market anywhere
on oarth, and at a reasonable price.
Chickens, ducks and geese also on
hand.
Don't Be Careless About Fire.
, We wish to sound a note of warning
concerning the carelessness that causes
fires this time of year. A firo in Doug
las City means the wiping out of the
greater portion of the town. Don't be
careless. Keep your lamps full and
clean, see that your ashes have no live
coals in them when thrown out?bo
careful?you may save your home or
the town by avoiding carelessness.
Go to Dr Harrisou's new dental par
lors, Douglas City, and have your teeth

he is right ""in it."" Come again.
Dan McKay, our next door neighbor
who has rendered the News much
of his time in getting started occupied I
j a chair in our sanctum Saturday,
j Mr. West of the firm of West Bros.,;
j of Port Wraugol, dropped in on us the '
! first of last week. He is one of the en- ?
! terprising business men of that nice!
j littlo city.
The Lone Fisherman, Tibpetts, cap
j tain, missed one or two trips between :
! Douglas City and Juneau last Friday. ;
The Taku wind that prevailed on that |
day kicked up an awful muss and made
crossing the channel rather dangerous.!
Dr. W. B. Dorr and Mr. Ceo. W. J
I i
Stepheusen favored the News with a ,
call last week. As a matter of history,
; wo wish to mention the fact that the j
Doctor favored the News job depart- j
ment with its first order for job work, j
Mr. Weesner, of the steam laundry i
of this city, was a caller at the News of- j
lice last week. He expressed himself I
as being highly pleased over the loca- j
tiou of a newspaper in this city, and |
[ his firm, Johnson &, Weesner, will bo (
heard from in our columns.
I Mr. (tus. B. Leach, of the Alaska
Mining Record, made us a pleasant
; call a few days ago. Mr. Leach is a;
jolly good follow and expects to see j
the News a financial success. He is
built on the wide gage idea, and though
a competitor in the business, he still !
wishes us to succeed.
I
Doctor Harrison, through whose in-;
fluence the people of Douglas City J
have cause to rejoice for, or regret, the 1
removal of tho News plant to Douglas j
Island, dropped in on us last Saturday
and talked science and religion with ?
the editor. After a flfteeu minute sit- !
ting he left very much refreshed.
Mr. D. J. Milan, of this city, but for- j
merly of tho police force of Seattle, \
was a welcome caller at the News otilce !
a few days ago. He is a rattling good
fellow and we regret to hear that ho is !
going to winter 011 the Sound; but he I
will return iu the spring. Mr. Milan ,
was our first subscri!>er to the News ;
and the great weekly will follow him to i
Seattle.
Our thanks are due Mr. J. F. McDon
ald for kindly assistance iu getting our
heavy machinery from the wharf to
our office on Paradise street. Jack's
kindness wiljftong be remembered. He j
always was a sympathetic cuss and he|
has a heart in him that compares only j
with the liver of a skate, which hangs .
in four sections and reaches from the I
thorax to the appendix.
Mr. M. J. O'Connor, the popular mer- !
chant, was a caller last Friday at our .
office. Our good judgment prevented j
trouble between Mr. O'Connor and the ;
News force, and all grow out of our cal- !
ler's peculiar conduct of insisting on j
paying a month's advertising in ad- j
vance. We finally concluded to accept
the money and Mr. O'Connor left,!
peace and harmony prevailing.
Mr. S. A. Boynton, the contractor
and builder who is building the Con- I
gregational church in this city called i
Saturday and talked over old times !
with the editor. Our first acquaintance
with him dates back to 1870 when we
first met him in Ottawa county Kan
sas. He was then a number one man,
and wo doubt not, as much will l>e said
of him wherovor he may go. As a me- '
chanic there are no better, and the
church trustees made a wise choice
in giving him tho contract to construct
the church.
A PJea.sant Surprise.
The Douglas City correspondent of ,
the Alaska Mining Record gave us the
following notico in the issue of that pa
per:
""The new paper to be known as the (
News has come to stay. Editor Mc
Bride is rapidly getting things in shape '
and will probably put out his first is
sue next Wednesday. The permanent
home of the new enterprise is in the
Hunter building, between Front and
Second streets. Mr. MoBride has
made scores of firm friends since his j
arrival in town, and the new journal is
bound to be a success from the start. ,
We extend the right hand of fraternal
fellowship.""

I LIMING BALL.
Fairly Good Attendance. A Tre
menduous Spread and Those
Who Served It.
TO JOIN THE: GIDDY WHIRL.
Our last issue contained a notice that i
a grand ball would be given iu Oilman's !
Hall 011 Thanksgiving night under the j
supervision of tho band boys of this |
city. The ball had also been advertised I
by tho posting and distribution of post- j
ers, but the fact is that here, as in most j
places, a party needs but little advor-1
tising to insure a good attendance.
' ^ ? i _ -i? -vt ,i '
A HOI! I U O ClOOK a i\tJwa xuuii iuuuu ;
the hall, which is a largo spacious room !
with a raised platform in one end, a J
stove in the other, well lighted by elec* ;
trie lamps and beautifully decorated
with flags and bunting. It was rather j
cold outside and some snow was fall
ing and so, on entering, our first move |
was towards the stove, which was sur
rounded with girls and women. There !
was but little lire and huddled up in
0110 corner of tho alcove in which tho '
stove was located was a young lady |
with a pure white dress on. One glance !
at that white dress was sufficient to !
cause the chills to commence running
up and down our back, and our teeth
chattered to the tune of ""Home, sweet
Home."" A boy soon appeared 011 the
scene with a beer bottle filled with oil
and commenced encouraging the fire
with it, but not until the girl, with the i
white dress on, left tho place where the j
stove was, did the coal and oil perform |
their usual functions. The youthful!
janitor would take the bottle of oil and
pour it in on the llaraos and whenever
the bottle came in sight in the hands
of the boy, there was a grand rush to
get away from iu front of the stove, j
When we observed this carelessness,:
we regretted that we had taken the j
trouble to write and publish an article
about fires in this city and the danger
that was resulting t hrough carelessness.
About half past 9 o'clock the orches
tra commenced playing a beautiful
waltz and with great haste the couples ;
soon comfortably filled the floor. Here !
as elsewhere, the waltz is the favorite j
dance. There is something about it
that dancers much admire. It really j
is a beautiful sight to see a floor full j
of waltzers whirling around the room
with a perfect stop, and our opinion is
that the Douglas City and Treadwell ,
dancers have got it down to perfection, j
There seemed to be a total absence of J
jumping that some waltzers get into !
the habit of doing. We felt sorry for
one fellow, however. He held his part
| nor at arms length. She was a beauti
ful waltzer and to us it seemed that
she several times tried to make a sneak
on him and get up a little closer?to
huddle up in the vicinity of his bo
som as it were?but ho wouldn't have
it that way. Poor fellow, he missed all
the fun, according to our way of think
ing, and overy effort she made to ""close
in"" on him was mildly repulsed. The
next time we go to report a dance in
this city, we will take a sand club
along to be used on the cold hearted
gentleman.
Quadrille and the other round dan
cos were announced in their turn ac
cording to their order in tho program.
In the former, nine sets were on the
floor at a time. We should judge the
square dancos are not very popular for
when tho caller gavo them a change,
something out of tho old worn out
""first four right and left"" etc., the dan
cers got mixed up so that it took thorn
a long time to get straightened out
again and into their proper places. Tho
caller oxplained the matter and tried
it again, but only to result in a second
mix-up in which arms and limbs seem
ed to bo more thoroughly ontanglod
than before. Tho caller smiled, but
finally succeeded in getting them
through the various changes in good
shano.
Among the dancers, Mrs. Howe, Mrs.
Dr. Harrison, Mrs. James and the Miss
es Falconer and McCormick deserve
special notice for grace and ease in the
waltz, while if a cake were offerod as a
prize, Mr. Herbert Wilson would take a
whole bakory.
AT THE SUPPER TABLE.
About 12 o'clock the floor manager
announced that supper was ready and
that thereafter tho grand march would
occur. The supper was given by the
Guild of the Episcopal church of this
J.
city in Odd Fellows' Hall on third
street. It -was a regular genuine
Thanksgiving dinner. The supply of
turkey and cranberry sauco was inex
haustible and liberally provided. The
preparation of the food was perfection
itself. A better dinner could not bo
desired. It was for the benefit of the
church. It was not necessary to say
that the supper wAs all right, in fact
could havo been no better, for the way
those who sat at the table ate, furnish
ed all tho evidence necessary. No
prizes wero given to those who ate tho
most, but if there had been, honors
wore easy between Mr. Taylor, Mr. M.
0. Howe and Dr. Harrison. On a toc
nical investigation the Dr. would prob
ably get tho prize. The supper was pro
pared by Mrs. R. Bently, Mrs. L. A. J
Anderson and Mrs. Falconer and the .
waiters wore tho Misses H. Johnson, j
Florenco Crofts, Maggie Shotter aud
Mrs. J. C.Roso.
AFTER SUPPER.
The grand march took place after
supper, as announced, after which
dancing was renewed and continued i
until a late hour. The party was a
pleasant one, but wo are informed that
the attendance was not as large as us
ual. Among those who attended wore !
some of the best people of the town |
and really wo were agreeably surprised j
to see such a turnout of lino looking j
people. We of course expected to see i
an average collection, but this one was I
far superior to the average turnout of
an Alaska city.
The music was excellent, could have j
been no better, and was provided by i
Prof. Clark Miller, Herbert Fullmer I
and Charles Fremont.
The Boys Give Thanks.
Douglas City has a lively lot of boys.
When wo say boys we don't exactly
mean young boys, but we include the
older fellows too. Few towns indeed
can claim so many generous wide-awake
men. Environment no doubt contrib- j
utes to make thorn so, for Douglas City j
is certainly a place where man may be I
happy. All those who want employ- j
mont can get it and none need ever
complain of want. This is a cash busi
ness town and everybody has money.!
Whether those so fortunately situa
ted are as appreciative of the fact as ;
they should be, we really do not know, I
but we believe they are. For the pur
pose of informing our readers on this j
subject a News man was ordered to i
take a stroll around town. Wo sent a !
mind reader on this mission and we
give his report.
Frank Bacli is thankful that trade is
good and that he has plenty of fuel
on hand.
Fox gave thanks that the victims of
his jokes still permit him to live.
Jack McDonald is thankful for his
superior knowledge of the winds.
Dr. Harrison gave thanks that all his
| signs are right side up.
M. C. Howe wa9 thankful that his
I appetite stayed with him over Thauks

j for having a big trade.
O'Connor was thankful that his 200
| pound Swiss Cheese was not quite all
i gone.
John Egan was more than thankful
that his new brewery is just what ho

James ""thanked awfully"" because ho

Corbus (the News man thought) was
thankful for having the best job in
Alaska.
Hale should be thankful for being
the best looking man at Treadwell.
Joe Edwards was thankful because
""not a wave of trouble rolls, across his
peaceful breast"".

RECEPTION OF TIE NEWS.
Our First Issue Cordially I^e*
ceived by the Douglas Is
land People. ?
WHAT THE NEWS HAN SAW,
TEie first issue of the News was gra
ciously received by tho readers of
Douglas City and Treadwell, and
the publishers feel very thankful for
the cordial reception that has been
given our first publication. A News
man strolled around town for a short
time as soon as the paper was being,
delivered. Tho writer handed our
neighbor, Mr. G. Roeno a paper. Two
- i- 1 ? 1
handsome women were standing oy,
""What! the new paper, aro you going
to slight us,"" said one. Of course
they were each supplied with a copy.
We went up to see our friend in the
Douglas Pharmacy. Just before we
got to the door wo heard some one
making an awful noise. A man was
running toward us and when ho saw
that we were looking at him, he com
menced to wave his hands and shout
at the top of his voice. We went to
meet him and with tears running out
of his eyes he begged for a copy of the
News. To see women and children cry
for our paper is not an uncommon:
thing, but for able bodied men to so
lose control of their feelings is a new
one oil us. ""Have you come to stay?'r
said another lady, as she glanced at
the local page and wiped away a tear
from her left eye. Ileing assured that
the News would always remain here to
' ? ttr. ji *i 1 i
greet ner every vvecinesuay sue ueouiue
composed and we bade her good bye
and strolled on. On Front street we
met John Egan; it was dusk by this
time. Ho was shoving a wheel barrow..
""The now paper out!"" said John..
""There's your paralyzer, the only re
ligious paper in Alaska"", said the News
man. John dropped the wheelbarrow
handles and looked the sheet over^
Then ho commenced to read. He kept
011 reading and wo commenced to get
cold. We had an overcoat on, but
John was in his shirt sleeves. The
wind was blowing and getting colder
every minute. Wo could see his trous
er legs flap in the mild Taku wind aa
it engaged in sundry and divers flirta
tions, but John read right on. Pres
ently his hat blew off and went whirl
ing toward the Standard Hall door, but
John paid no attention to his hat and
kept on reading the great newspaper of
I Alaska. Just how long John stood
there without coat or hat reading the
News we don't know for we got so aw
ful cold that wo left to find some good
hot stove. He may have stayod there
all night for all wo know.
Of course these incidents are gratify
ing to tho publishers. We are publish
ing a paper for the people and to please
them will bo our constant aim.

Little Myrtle McWilliama, the seven
year old dauglitor of Mr. and Mrs.
McWilliams of this city, died last Fri
day morning. Little Myrtle had been
sick for some time with scarlatina but
was supposed to be getting better un
til Thursday night, when a physician
was summoned from Juneau, the ferry
boat making an extra trip to carry him
to this city; but no power could save.
The immediate cause of death was
hemorrhage of the lungs. Tlio funeral
took place last Saturday and the inter
ment was mude at Juneau, the re
mains, mourners, and friends being
conveyed to that city on the ferryboat
on the 1 o'clock trip. The parents
have the sympathy of all in the losa
of a lovely child. ""He who gave haa
taken away.""
Christmas Tree Ornaments.
A largo and beautiful stock of Christ
mas tree ornaments, etc. has been re
ceived on the last boat for the Charles
Coffoe House on Front street. These
goods should bo seen by everybody.
Come early and get your choice.
The Lamp was Loaded.
A miner's lamp carried by Thomas
Madden exploded at Troadwell last
Thursday forenoon, from the effects of
which he received severe injuries by
j being burned on the neck and other
portions of the body. He was immedi
' ately removed to the hospital, where,
! under the excellent care and treatment
| of Dr. Dorr he is rapidly recovering.
